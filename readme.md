An approach to Parameterized, Distributed, Heterogeneous Machine Learning using Airflow

Goal : Scale Machine Learning system like AutoML across multiple programming languages, i.e., use python, R, Spark ML, etc. together for ML tasks like choosing a machine learning model, tuning hyper-parameters, avoiding overfitting and optimization for a provided evaluation metric.

Languages and Platforms chosen: 
Apache Airflow  to author workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of tasks.  
Python(scikit-learn), R for machine learning libraries.
